# WeightLoss-Network-Analysis
\**Original data stored in* `WeightLoss` *and* `WeightLoss/networks` *folders*

## Data Pre-processing
\**All processed data stored in* `ProcessedData` *folder*

- `Consolidate_Data_and_Filter_Missing.ipynb` - consolidates all useful data from original and stores in `valid_user_info_consolidated.csv`

- `Network_Filtering.ipynb` - detects subset of user nodes that have degrees of at least 5 in all 3 subgraphs. Stores nodes in `included_users_(sorted).csv` and subgraph edge lists in `friend_edges.csv`, `comment_edges.csv`, and `mention_edges.csv`

- `Label_and_Feature_Extraction.ipynb` - filters consolidated data in `valid_user_info_consolidated.csv` by users in `included_users_(sorted).csv`. Then splits into features and labels, stored in `features.csv` and `labels.csv` respectively

- `statistics.py` and `Other_Data_Statistics.ipynb` contain computations for some statistics on the dataset

## Models and Training
- `models.py` - contains the neural network models that we implemented and trained on
- `Model_Training.ipynb` - performs grid search over specified hyperparameter sets for the given data and model; evaluates validation and test rMSEs
- `Training_with_Loss_Plots.py` - trains given data and model with specified hyperparameter set; plots the train and test losses (rMSEs)

## Other
- `Results` - contains the raw results on various runs of `Model_Training.ipynb`
- `Loss Plots` - contains various loss plots generated by `Training_with_Loss_Plots.py`
